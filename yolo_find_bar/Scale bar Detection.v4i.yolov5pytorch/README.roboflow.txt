The dataset includes 53 images.
Scale-bar are annotated in YOLO v5 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Grayscale (CRT phosphor)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Random exposure adjustment of between -20 and +20 percent
